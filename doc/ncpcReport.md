* Proto-documentation:

The report heading lists the dates for your beat that are included.
In the map, incidents that OPD has assigned to your beat(s) are shown
in large red circles.  A relaxed "bounding box" around these incidents
is shown as a gray rectangle.  This region defines a larger set of
other incidents in the vicinity of your beat.  These other adjacent
incidents are marked with smaller black dots.  (Black dots within the
beat seem to suggest incidents with incorrect beat assignment by OPD.)

Yellow dots correspond to incidents described only in Patrol logs, but
not in the standard incident reporting.

Clicking on any dot will pop-up date and crime type information
particular to that incident.  The highlighted blue incident number is
a hot link that goes to an incident-specific report page.

Above the map is a blue "Download beat data" button.  Clicking it will
download A CSV file to your computer.  It containing all incidents
associated with your beat (but not those only in the vicinity) during
the time period.

Your beat's data for the last 60 days is shown in a map of larger
Oakland.  You should (depending on your web browser client's
capabilities) be able to shift and zoom into this map to capture
your region as you wish.
